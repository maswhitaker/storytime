  <h1>Where it all began..</h1>
  <h2>There is a story of a girl, who had it all in highschool. The looks, popularity, intelligence. The whole nine yards. Her name was Rebecca Ashley Yarnall. The one thing she was missing from her life was a boy who appreciated all that she was. Fortunately, their last names are close together in the alphabet.</h2>

  <h2>This boy was very lucky to have the chance to sit next to such a beautiful girl. The chance was taken away although when he was dropped from the Pre-calc class they had together for not having the class pre-requsites because he wasnt as smart as the girl.</h2>
  <h2>How sad... but luckily for him, he would have another opportunity.</h2>

<h1>Soon the beautiful couple started dating even though they both knew what was to come at the end of summer.. the girl was going to go away for college.</h1>

<h1>Becca would come back from college every so often, and the boy would go up to visit her also. Things were working well, even though they were distant.</h1>
<h1>She never understood why he would always like to take pictures of her randomly when she came back to visit, she thought they were always ugly and just didnt understand the point in keeping the photos.</h1>
